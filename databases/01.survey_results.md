# Survey Results

On September 30, [Gustavo Tavares](https://github.com/grstavares) and [Renato Losio](https://github.com/rlosio) published a survey to get the community's understanding of Serverless Databases.  
The survey close its collection period on October 20 with 32 answers.  
This page documents the results of the survey and provides a preliminary analysis of its answers.

## Understanding of Serverless Databases

### What is a Serverless Database?

In the survey, we asked the community what would be the principles that a Database should follow to be considered Serverless.  
We offered a few predefined choices and allowed adding new choices.  
The offered choices were:

- No manual server management
- Automatic, elastic app/service scale
- Built-in resilience and inherently fault-tolerant service
- Always available and instant access
- Consumption-based
- Survive any failure domain, including regions
- Geographic scale
- Transactional guarantees
- SQL support
- Data API

Based on the responses we have a clear cluster of principles that most of the respondents agrees on:

![No manual server management: 81% of the respondents. Automatic, elastic app/service scale: 81% of the respondents. Consumption-based: 72%  of the respondents. Built-in resilience and inherently fault-tolerant service: 69% of the respondents. Always available and instant access: 59% of respondents. Data API: 34% of respondents. Transactional guarantees: 28% of respondents. Survive any failure domain, including regions: 25% of respondents. Geographic scale: 25% of the respondents. SQL support: 22% of the respondents.](./image/01.principles.png 'Serverless Database Principles')

Some respondents mentioned additional principles, like:

- No network requirement

Our analysis is that, according to the community, at this date, a Serverless Database must present the following characteristics, in order of importance:

1. No manual server management
2. Automatic, elastic app/service scale
3. Consumption-based
4. Built-in resilience and inherently fault-tolerant service
5. Always available and instant access

(\*) We consider accepted the principles that achieve at least 50% of agreement from the participants of the survey.

## Understanding of the Current State of the Market

### From a set of examples, what are the current existent Serverless Offers in the Market

After trying to understand what would be a Serverless Database,  
we asked the community to evaluate a few existent offers in the market.  
The respondents could affirm whether a specific offer is considered or not as a Serverless Database.  
Instead of classifying the offer, the respondents also could inform they don't know the offer that we suggested.

The first information that we can take from the answers is the level of knowledge about the offers.  
And the offers provided by AWS have the biggest level of knowledge from the part of the respondents.

![1 respondent doesn't know DynamoDB. 5 respondents don't know S3+Athena. 7 respondents don't know Aurora version 1. 6 respondents don't know Aurora version 2. 16 respondents don't know Firebase. 18 respondents don't know MongoDB Atlas Serverless. 20 respondents don't know Azure Cosmos DB. 21 respondents don't know Cloudflare D1.](./image/02.know_offers.png 'Know Serverless Database Offers')

A question that can be made, based on the answers is the possibility of a biased selection of the respondents.  
We accept that the places where the survey was announced tend to have persons more active on AWS than the other cloud providers.  
We plan to address this in the next steps of this project.

Regarding which databases are considered Serverless, we got the below results:

![Of the people that know DynamoDB, 25 classified it as Serverless Database while 4 people classified it as not a Serverless Database. Of the people that know S3+Athena, 15  classified it as Serverless Database while 9 people classified it as not a Serverless Database. Of the people that know Aurora V1 13 classified it as Serverless Database while 10 people classified it as not a Serverless Database.Of the people that know Aurora V2 13 classified it as Serverless Database while 10 people classified it as not a Serverless Database.Of the people that know Firebase 12 classified it as Serverless Database while 2 people classified it as not a Serverless Database.Of the people that know MongoDB Atlas Serverless 9 classified it as Serverless Database while 2 people classified it as not a Serverless Database.Of the people that know Azure Cosmos DB 8 classified it as Serverless Database while 2 people classified it as not a Serverless Database.Of the people that know Cloudflare D1 6 classified it as Serverless Database while 2 people classified it as not a Serverless Database.](./image/03.databases.png 'Are these databases Serverless?')

In a more detailed analysis, all mentioned databases, considering only the respondents that know each offer, are below the 50% threshold.  
That means that more than half of respondents consider the offers as a Serverless Database.

![DynamoDB is considered a Serverless Database by 86% of people that know it. Firebase is considered a Serverless Database by 86% of people that know it. MongoDB Atlas Serverless is considered a Serverless Database by 82% of people that know it. Azure Cosmos DB is considered a Serverless Database by 80% of people that know it. Cloudflare D1 is considered a Serverless Database by 75% of people that know it. S3+Athena is considered a Serverless Database by 63% of people that know it. AWS Aurora V1 is considered a Serverless Database by 57% of people that know it. AWS Aurora V2 is considered a Serverless Database by 57% of people that know it.](./image/04.databases.png 'Are these databases Serverless?')

Finally, we asked about other Database Offers that could be considered Serverless. A few choices were mentioned:

- Amazon Timestream
- Amazon QLDB
- Big Query
- Fauna
- PlanetScale
- Redpanda
- Azure Storage Account
- Sknowflake
- Redshift Serverless

In the same question, we also received a few suggestions that the local or remote file systems should be considered as Serverless Database offers.  
We want to discuss this additional suggestion at a later moment.

From a more generic perspective, we asked if the respondents were able to name a so-called Serverless Database on each of the main Cloud Public Providers (AWS, GCP, and Azure).

![46.7% of the respondents can name at least one Serverless Database for each cloud public provider. 36.7% of the respondents can not name at least one Serverless Database for each cloud public provider. 16.7% of the respondents are not sure if they can name at least one Serverless Database for each cloud public provider.](./image/05.cloud_providers_offers.png 'Cloud Providers Offer Awareness')

Regarding the existent offers, the two questions mentioned above tried to look at the current state.  
But we also were curious about how the community sees the future of Serverless Databases.

For that, we added a question to understand,  
based on the experience and knowledge of the respondents,  
Where they expect that Serverless Databases will gain market.

The question accepted multiple answers.  
It was answered by 90% of the respondents.

![72.4% of the respondents mentioned Event-Driven Architectures 69% of the respondents mentioned Traditional Web Applications requiring elasticity. 69% of the respondents mentioned Business intelligence and Data Warehouse Applications.](./image/06.future_market.png 'Which areas do you expect serverless databases to gain market?')

We also asked a more generic question about the future of Serverless Databases.

![85.7% of the respondents mentioned Managed Services by Main Cloud Providers 35.7% of the respondents mentioned NewSQL databases. 21.4% of the respondents mentioned Other Open Source Solutions. 17.9% of the respondents mentioned newer areas like Machine Learning.](./image/07.future_serveless.png 'The future of serverless data is likely')

## Challenges and opportunities of Serverless Databases

Finally, we moved our focus to the current experience of the respondents.  
We asked about their goal for using Serverless Databases.

We offered two predefined choices and left space available for them to provide new ones that were not listed.

We got 29 responses to that question.  
22 answered with our suggested goals and 7 with additional goals.  
We evaluated the additional goals and clustered them around two concepts.

![54% of the respondents answered that the main goal is Elasticity 25% of the respondents answered that the main goal is Cost Reduction/Optimization. 14% of the respondents answered that the main goal is Reduced Operations. 7% of the respondents answered that the main goal is Improved Developer Experience.](./image/08.main_goal.png 'What is your main goal of moving / thinking to moving a workload to a database serverless?')

## The challenges

In the survey, we had a Free Text question where the respondents could mention the biggest challenge of Serverless Databases based on their experience.

Per the nature of the free text answers, is hard to mention everything here.  
But we went through all of them and clustered the challenges.

It is not possible to have a direct one-to-one relationship between the answers and the challenges,  
But we believe the results shared here provide a good summary of the respondents' answers.

According to the researchers' understanding, the challenges are (in order of importance):

## The excitement

We also used a free text question to try to grasp what opportunities the community sees with Serverless Databases.  
Again, we summarized and clustered the answers here:

- Serverless Databases free the developers from Infrastructure Burdens.
- Serverless Databases allow Developers to focus on Business Logic.
- Serverless Databases can solve scalability and performance issues.
- Serverless Databases can decrease energy consumption.
- Serverless Databases can decrease costs.
- Serverless Databases evolve according to the providers' actions.
